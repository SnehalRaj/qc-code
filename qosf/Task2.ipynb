    "BONUS QUESTION:\n",
    "How to make sure you produce state |01>+|10> and not |01>-|10>?\n",
    "(Actually for more careful readers, the “correct” version of this question is posted below:\n",
    "How to make sure you produce state  |01⟩+|10⟩  and not any other combination of |01>+e(i*phi)|10⟩ (for example |01⟩-|10⟩)?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, let's first understand what a state is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of a combination of qubits is a collection of conditions that the arrangement of qubits meets. These conditions\n",
    "are in relation to a certain basis, and more specifically, a linear combination of said basis states. For example, the state\n",
    "|0> is a linear combination of the basis states α|0>+β|1>, where α=1 and β=0 (these states are written in ket notation, \n",
    "but they can also be written in vector notation too). Said coefficients must comply with the rule that the sum of the \n",
    "squares of the coefficients must be equal to 1, since the square of the absolute value of each coefficient determines the\n",
    "probability of measuring that basis state (Born's rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "These coefficients don't need to be positive or even real numbers. They can also be completely imaginary or complex, and\n",
    "so the state |0>-i|1> is perfectly valid, as well as |0>+|1>, |0>-|1> and |0>+i|1>. However, at measurement, they will \n",
    "all return |0> or |1> 50% of the time each. So how can we differentiate between these states? We won't be able to tell \n",
    "with measurement alone, since they all have the same probabilities. The only way to differentiate them is to put them \n",
    "through gates that modify the coefficients of the states. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's go back to the original question: how to ensure that we are producing |01>+|10> in our circuit and not any other \n",
    "state that has the same probability output?\n",
    "\n",
    "As established before, we need more gates to differentiate between the two. Without getting into excessive detail, a CNOT\n",
    "followed by a CNOT is the same as nothing, so that way we can measure each qubit independently. Then we can reconstruct a\n",
    "Hadamard gate with RX and RY, mapping the state |+> to |0> and |-> to |1>. What we would find is that the first qubit is \n",
    "in either state |+> or |->, depending on what we measured, due to the fact that we put an RY gate there at the start. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, skipping over some maths, we would see that the |+> state is the one that allows the state |01>+|10> to exist once \n",
    "combined with the CNOT, and the |-> state allows the |01>-|10> state to exist when combined with the CNOT. So we know that \n",
    "we must limit the first qubit to only being in the |+> state. We don't have to worry about any other states producing the \n",
    "same output probabilities since we have limited the first qubit to just rotation around the Y axis, and so the only \"threat\" \n",
    "was the |-> state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do we limit the first qubit to just being |+> and not |->? If the gradient descent had as input the parameters\n",
    "themselves, this would be solved a lot more quickly, but I doubt that is the point of the exercise. So, since we only have\n",
    "the counts of the states, what can we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that, with a qubit initialized at |0>, a Y rotation of pi/2 will map it to |+> and a Y rotation of 3*pi/2 will \n",
    "map it to |->. For a second, let's think of the case where we see that the first qubit has more 0s than 1s appearing. That \n",
    "means that the phase is around either pi/3 or 5*pi/3 approximately. If we increase the phase of that gate (params[0]), in \n",
    "the case where it was pi/3, we'll see that shift to around pi/2, and in the case of 5*pi/3, we'll see that shift to around \n",
    "2*pi==0. So in the first case, the output of 0s and 1s will be the same, while in the second case the output of 0s will \n",
    "have increased even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see then that whenever there are more 0s than 1s when measuring the first qubit, we must tell our algorithm to \n",
    "increase the value of the parameter, and whenever there are more 1s than 0s, we tell it to decrease it. This way, the \n",
    "value will almost always end up being pi/2. This is exactly what the code above does. The only situation where the \n",
    "algorithm will give us a params[0] value of 3*pi/2 is if params[0] is already 3*pi/2 and params[1] is pi already from \n",
    "the start, because then it will already give us the correct counts and the algorithm will not be inclined to modify any \n",
    "parameter, returning the undesired values.\n"
